            Exquisite Menus is a web application that displays a collection of unique tasting menus from various restaurants around the world. Each menu has been generated using GPT-4, an advanced AI language model developed by OpenAI. The menus provide detailed information about each course, including a description, price, and suggested wine pairing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The JavaScript code generates a dynamic list of restaurant menus, allowing users to easily browse and select a menu to view. Users can also choose to view a random menu by clicking on the "Show random menu" button. The application also includes a feature that allows users to show or hide images of the courses in the menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that the grand total prices shown on the menus exclude the cost of wine due to significant market fluctuations. Additionally, GPT-4's knowledge is based on data up to September 2021, which may lead to biases and overestimations for wine prices in 2023.
